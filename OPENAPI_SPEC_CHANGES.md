# OpenAPI Specification Updates - Summary

## Overview

The OpenAPI specification has been completely updated to match the **actual frontend implementation**. The previous version was missing critical fields and didn't reflect the consolidated endpoint structure that the frontend uses.

## Key Changes

### 1. Primary Endpoint Added

**NEW ENDPOINT:** `GET /api/v1/dashboard/{username}`

This is the **PRIMARY endpoint** used by the frontend. It returns ALL dashboard data in a single consolidated response, including:

- Maintainer metrics (invisible labor score, review impact, etc.)
- Burnout risk assessment with indicators and recommendations
- Sentiment analysis with word frequency and feedback distribution
- Community metrics (thank you messages, mentorship sessions, etc.)
- User profile with achievements, skills, and testimonials
- Recent activity timeline
- Repository health status for all repositories
- Alerts and notifications

### 2. Missing Fields Added

The following fields were missing from the previous spec but are **actively used in the UI**:

#### Metrics Object

- `responseTime` - Average response time in hours (displayed on dashboard)
- `totalContributions` - Total number of contributions (displayed on dashboard)
- `mentorshipHours` - Hours spent mentoring (displayed on dashboard)

#### Activity Distribution

- **Complete activity distribution array** with 5 categories:
  - Code Reviews
  - Issue Triage
  - Mentorship
  - Documentation
  - Discussions
- Each with `category`, `value`, `percentage`, and `color` fields

#### Burnout Object

- `recoveryMetrics` object with:
  - `daysOff` - Days off taken in last 30 days
  - `delegatedTasks` - Number of tasks delegated
  - `reducedScope` - Percentage of scope reduced

#### Sentiment Object

- `wordFrequency` array - Word cloud data with sentiment classification
- `feedbackDistribution` object - Breakdown of feedback types
- `topPositiveFeedback` array - Recent positive feedback messages
- `concernAreas` array - Areas that need attention

#### Community Metrics Object

- Complete object with all fields used in invisible labor page:
  - `thankYouMessages`
  - `helpedContributors`
  - `mentorshipSessions`
  - `conflictsResolved`
  - `documentationImproved`
  - `communityGrowth`

#### Profile Object

- `achievements` array - User achievements and badges
- `skills` array - Skill assessments across categories
- `testimonials` array - Community testimonials
- `impactSummary` object with:
  - `totalReviews`
  - `issuesTriaged`
  - `contributorsHelped`
  - `documentationPages`
  - `communityImpact`
  - `timeInvested`
- `topRepositories` array - Top contributed repositories

#### Alerts Array

- Alert notifications with:
  - `id`, `type`, `title`, `message`, `timestamp`

#### Recent Activity Array

- Timeline events with:
  - `id`, `timestamp`, `type`, `title`, `description`
  - `repository`, `impact`
  - `linkedPR`, `linkedIssue` (optional)

#### Repository Health Array

- Complete repository health metrics:
  - `id`, `name`, `healthScore`
  - `contributors`, `activeContributors`
  - `issuesResolved`, `issuesOpen`
  - `prsMerged`, `prsOpen`
  - `lastActivity`, `responseTime`
  - `sentiment`, `stars`, `forks`

### 3. Complete FastAPI Implementation

Added a **complete, production-ready FastAPI implementation** including:

- All Pydantic models with proper validation
- CORS middleware configuration
- Error handling with proper HTTP status codes
- Type hints and documentation
- Implementation checklist for backend developers

### 4. Field Name Consistency

The spec now uses **camelCase** field names to match the frontend's expectations:

- `invisibleLaborScore` (not `invisible_labor_score`)
- `reviewImpactScore` (not `review_impact_score`)
- `communityEngagement` (not `community_engagement`)
- etc.

## Files Modified

1. **OPENAPI_SPEC.md** - Complete rewrite with:
   - Consolidated endpoint specification
   - Complete response structure
   - FastAPI implementation example
   - Implementation checklist

## Data Flow

```
Frontend Request:
GET http://10.7.29.62:8000/api/v1/dashboard/{username}

Backend Response:
{
  "metrics": { /* All KPI metrics */ },
  "burnout": { /* Burnout assessment */ },
  "sentiment": { /* Sentiment analysis */ },
  "communityMetrics": { /* Community engagement */ },
  "profile": { /* User profile with achievements */ },
  "alerts": [ /* Notifications */ ],
  "recentActivity": [ /* Timeline events */ ],
  "repositoryHealth": [ /* Repository stats */ ]
}
```

## Implementation Priority

### Must Have (Used by all dashboard pages):

1. `metrics` object with all fields
2. `burnout` object with indicators and recommendations
3. `sentiment` object with analysis data
4. `communityMetrics` object
5. `profile` object with impactSummary
6. `repositoryHealth` array

### Should Have (Used by some pages):

1. `alerts` array - Dashboard alerts
2. `recentActivity` array - Timeline page

### Nice to Have:

1. Profile achievements and testimonials
2. Top repositories

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Endpoint returns 200 OK for valid username
- [ ] Endpoint returns 404 for invalid username
- [ ] All required fields are present in response
- [ ] Field names match camelCase convention
- [ ] Response time is under 2 seconds
- [ ] CORS headers are set correctly
- [ ] Error responses follow standard format

## Next Steps for Backend Team

1. Implement the `/api/v1/dashboard/{username}` endpoint using the provided FastAPI code
2. Set up data sources (GitHub API, database, cache)
3. Implement core calculation algorithms
4. Add caching layer (30-60 second TTL recommended)
5. Test with frontend using the actual API URL
6. Monitor performance and optimize queries

## Notes

- The previous OpenAPI spec had fragmented endpoints that weren't being used
- The frontend expects a single consolidated endpoint
- All field names must be in camelCase
- Response should be cacheable for 30-60 seconds
- Error responses must include error code, message, and timestamp
